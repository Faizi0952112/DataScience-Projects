# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN

This repository contains a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** implementation in TensorFlow/Keras for classifying images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build and train a deep learning model that can classify images into **10 categories**:
- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

The dataset consists of **60,000 32x32 color images**, split into 50,000 training and 10,000 testing samples.
